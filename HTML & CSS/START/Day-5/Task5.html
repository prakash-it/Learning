    <h1>World Goverment</h1>

    <p>A world government with executive, legislative, and judicial functions and an administrative apparatus has never existed.
         The inception of the United Nations (UN) in the mid-20th century remains the closest approximation to a world government, as it is by far the largest and most powerful international institution. The UN is mostly limited to an advisory role, with the stated purpose of fostering cooperation between existing national governments, rather than exerting authority over them. 
        Nevertheless, the organization is commonly viewed as either a model for, or preliminary step towards, a global government.</p>
