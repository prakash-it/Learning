    <h2>HTML Terms</h2>
    <dl>
       <dt>HTML:</dt>
       <dd>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is used to structure content on the web. If you want to create a simple one-line HTML document</dd>
       <dt>HTML element:</dt>
       <dd>If you want to display a single line of text in HTML, you can use the element. The element is an inline container that doesn't add any specific formatting to the content it wraps</dd>
       <dt>HTML tag:</dt>
       <dd>In HTML, the <span> tag is often used for applying styles or scripting to a specific section of text within a line. It is an inline element and does not add any line breaks</dd>
       <dt>HTML attribute:</dt>
       <dd>It seems like your question is a bit unclear. If you're asking about an HTML attribute that can be used to create a one-line layout or structure, there isn't a specific attribute designed for that purpose</dd>
       <dt>HTML comment:</dt>
       <dd>The content within the < !-- and -- >" tags will be treated as a comment and will not be displayed in the browser when the HTML page is rendered. Comments are useful for adding notes or explanations within the HTML code without affecting the visible content on the webpage.</dd>
       <dt>HTML object:</dt>
       <dd>The <span> tag is an inline container that doesn't add any line breaks and is often used to apply styles or manipulate text within a larger block of content.</dd>
       <dt>HTML special charater:</dt>
       <dd>If you're looking to define a special character in HTML for a single line, you can use the HTML entity or character entity reference. This is a way to represent characters that have a special meaning in HTML, such as <, >, &, etc., or characters that are not easily typable on a keyboard.</dd>
